API = Application Programming Interface

APIs are interfaces that abstract away the inner workings of complex
packages of code so a developer can worry only about the input
and output.

Common uses of Web API = store, share, & update data

All you need to do is know where and how you need to send your request
to get the data you need, or perform the action you desire.

- web API server should be able to accept all methods
(GET, POST, PUT/PATCH and DELETE) in a request.

RESTful APIs:
- Representational State Transfer
- architectural constraints:
    1. Decoupled client-server: The client and the server should be decoupled so
     that they can evolve separately without any dependence on one another.
    2. Stateless: This means that there is no necessary session between the client
     and the server. Data received from the server can be used by the client independently.
     This allows you to have short discrete operations. Luckily, this is a natural fit for
     HTTP operations in which requests are intended to be independent and short-lived.
    3. Uniform interface: RESTful endpoints are meant to be self-describing and uniform in
     their definition. Each operation is intended to be separated by a separate endpoint or URL.
     In practical real world terms, most RESTful endpoints implement the classic CRUD
     (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations against a resource that could just happen to be
     in your data model. This uniformity allows developers to easily learn the usage pattern of
     each endpoint.

A Web API's main role is to transmit data, usually in the form of JSON,
and perform CRUD actions. It can render HTML pages, but is not its primary role.
