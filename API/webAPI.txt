API = Application Programming Interface

APIs are interfaces that abstract away the inner workings of complex
packages of code so a developer can worry only about the input
and output.

Common uses of Web API = store, share, & update data

All you need to do is know where and how you need to send your request
to get the data you need, or perform the action you desire.

REST APIs:
A web API server should be able to accept all methods
(GET, POST, PUT/PATCH and DELETE) in a request.

A Web API's main role is to transmit data, usually in the form of JSON,
and perform CRUD actions. It can render HTML pages, but is not its primary role.
